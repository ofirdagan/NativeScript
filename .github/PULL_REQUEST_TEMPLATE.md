Dear friend, we, the rest of the NativeScript community thank you for your
contribution! As we want to present a really nice, readable changelog with each
release, we ask you to fill the following information:

### Inform what relation and with which issue does it have (in other words, delete the unnecessary):
Fixes/Implements #[Issue Number].

### Does it have [unit tests](https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript/blob/master/running-tests.md)?
If not, why?
If not, can you list any steps to test it manually?
