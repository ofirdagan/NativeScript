Welcome, dear friend! We, the rest of the NativeScript community really
appreciate your feedback! While we are doing all we can to take care of every
issue, sometimes we get overwhelmed. Because of that, we will consider issues
that are not constructive or report problems that cannot be reproduced "dead".
In accordance, we will treat feature requests or bug reports with unanswered
questions regarding the behavior/reproduction "dead". All "dead" issues will
get closed.

## Please, help the others with the details below:

### Did you verify this is a real problem with a search in [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/nativescript)?

### Tell us about the problem

### Which version of NativeScript did you use (check the 'version' atrribute in the node_modules/tns-core-modules/package.json file)

### Try to recall what were you doing

### Is there code involved? Can you share the minimum of it to get the problem?
