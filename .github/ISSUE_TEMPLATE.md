Welcome dear friend! We, the rest of the NativeScript community really
appreciate your feedback! While we are doing all we can to take care of every
issue, sometimes we get overwhelmed. Because of that, we will consider issues
that are not constructive or report problems that cannot be reproduced "dead".
In accordance, we will treat feature requests or bug reports with unanswered
questions regarding the behavior/reproduction for more than 20 days "dead". All
"dead" issues will get closed.
